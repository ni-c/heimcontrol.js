# heimcontrol-arduino

*arduino* is an Arduino plugin for the node.js app [heimcontrol.js](https://github.com/heimcontroljs/heimcontrol.js) on the Raspberry PI.

## Implemented

- **rc-switch** â€“ Use your Arduino to operate remote radio controlled devices. This will most likely work with all popular low cost power outlet sockets. (see: [http://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/](http://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/))

## Installation

To install arduino, navigate to your heimcontrol.js folder and run npm:

````
npm install https://github.com/heimcontroljs/plugin-arduino/tarball/master
````
